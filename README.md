# Medical-Prescription-OCR

This project uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology, specifically EasyOCR, to extract relevant information from medical prescriptions, such as medication names, dosages, and the duration for taking the medication. It also leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques like named entity recognition (NER) to accurately interpret and structure the extracted information.
